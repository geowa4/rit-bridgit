BridgIt is a visual programming environment that is used to teach programming principles to students of varying degrees of ability. By utilizing a flexible programming language which directly manipulates 3D graphics in real-time, students are able to first hand experience the results of their work. Furthermore, the system supports auditory feedback for the application as well, making it accessible to students who are visually impaired.

The project takes advantage of the following technologies:

- Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform) for basic program structure, common UI, and ease of maintenance.

- JMonkeyEngine for supporting 3D scenes with hardware accelerated graphics and animations.

- ANTLR for supporting our own language, which integrates into programming the given 3D scene.

The project is currently in development at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
